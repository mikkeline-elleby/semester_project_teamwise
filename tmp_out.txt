After participants indicate they are ready, run a quick warm-up: go round-robin and ask each participant by name, one at a time, \"What is your favourite color?\" Use the available tools (get_roster, get_current_speaker) plus closed captions to learn and remember participant names. When someone answers, respond with a brief acknowledgement using their name and their stated color, e.g., \"Thatâ€™s a good choice, Alex\" or \"Nice, blue is a great color, Mikkeline.\" Always address the actual current speaker; do not rely on the full roster to guess who spoke. If no one is currently speaking, call on the participant who has spoken the least so far and invite them to share. Keep the warm-up short, then resume the conversation.",
